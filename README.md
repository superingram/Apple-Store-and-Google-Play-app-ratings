# Apple-Store-and-Google-Play-app-ratings

The basic idea behind this project is to determine whether Apple Store apps receive better reviews than Google Play apps.  Two data sets on Apple ratings and Google ratings will be joined, column labels will be normalized and datatypes within the data sets will be changes appropriately.  The appropriate colums will be chosen, null values will be removed and records with at least one rating will be kept.  Permutation testing will be used to determine if the platform has any bearing on ratings and whether to reject the Null Hypothesis.
